This could highlight the impact of clinical pretraining on bias. *Validity: Moderate to High, feasible if a general BERT can be run on the same data, though direct comparison requires careful consideration of performance differences.*\n","    3.  **Extension: Focus on a Different Protected Attribute:** If data permits, analyze fairness gaps for another attribute like `ETHNICITY_CLEAN` or `LANGUAGE_CLEAN`. *Validity: Depends heavily on data availability and diversity in the demo set for that attribute.*\n","* **Insights on Prompting:** \"My initial prompt was broad.

Visualization: Downstream Task Fairness Gaps\n","\n","This plot shows the calculated fairness gaps between the demographic groups (Male vs. Female, with Female as the reference group for subtraction: Metric_Male - Metric_Female) for the downstream task. The gaps visualized are:\n","-   Demographic Parity Gap\n","-   Recall Gap (Equality of Opportunity for Positives)\n","-   Specificity Gap (Equality of Opportunity for Negatives)\n","-   False Positive Rate (FPR) Gap\n","-   Predictive Equality (Precision) Gap (from our extension)\n","\n","These values are taken from the `fairness_gaps_report` dictionary generated in Block 12 and updated in Block 13. A gap close to zero indicates more fairness according to that specific metric."],"metadata":{"id":"oRQgQt7Raqgt"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# In Block 17, replace the text annotation loop with this:\n","\n","if gap_names:\n","    plot_df_gaps = pd.DataFrame({'Fairness Gap Type': gap_names, 'Gap Value': gap_values})\n","\n","    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8)) # Slightly wider and taller for clarity\n","    barplot = sns.barplot(\n","        x='Gap Value',\n","        y='Fairness Gap Type',\n","        data=plot_df_gaps,\n","        hue='Fairness Gap Type',\n","        palette=\"coolwarm\",\n","        dodge=False,\n","        legend=False\n","    )\n","    plt.title(f'Downstream Task Fairness Gaps ({fairness_gaps_report.get(\"comparison\", \"Group1 vs Group0\")})', fontsize=16)\n","    plt.xlabel('Gap Value (Group_M - Group_F)', fontsize=13)\n","    plt.ylabel('Type of Fairness Gap', fontsize=13)\n","    plt.axvline(0, color='black', lw=1, ls='--') # Made line slightly thicker\n","\n","    # Determine appropriate x-axis limits to give space for text\n","    min_val = plot_df_gaps['Gap Value'].min()\n","    max_val = plot_df_gaps['Gap Value'].max()\n","    padding = (max_val - min_val) * 0.15 # Add 15% padding on each side for text\n","    plt.xlim(min_val - padding, max_val + padding)\n","\n","    for index, row in plot_df_gaps.iterrows():\n","        text_val = f\"{row['Gap Value']:.4f}\"\n","        bar_val = row['Gap Value']\n","\n","        # Place text inside the bar, near the end, or just outside if bar is too small\n","        if abs(bar_val) < (max_val - min_val) * 0.05: # If bar is very small\n","             # Place text outside very small bars\n","            text_x = bar_val + np.sign(bar_val) * (max_val-min_val) * 0.02 # Small offset outside\n","            ha = 'left' if bar_val >= 0 else 'right'\n","        elif bar_val >= 0:\n","            text_x = bar_val - (max_val - min_val) * 0.015 # Inside, near right end\n","            ha = 'right'\n","        else: # bar_val < 0\n","            text_x = bar_val + (max_val - min_val) * 0.015 # Inside, near left end\n","            ha = 'left'\n","\n","        plt.text(text_x, # x-coordinate for text\n","                 index,    # y-coordinate (bar index)\n","                 text_val,\n","                 color='black',\n","                 ha=ha,\n","                 va='center',\n","                 fontsize=9)\n","\n","    plt.tight_layout() # Apply after all elements are added\n","    plt.show()\n","\n","    print(\"\\nData used for fairness gap plot:\")\n","    print(plot_df_gaps)\n","# ... rest of your code ..."],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":201},"id":"lh4e_raJayz2","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1746640482840,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":49,"user":{"displayName":"Ritul Soni","userId":"17646044374789351377"}},"outputId":"65a951ad-5f30-4b9b-d926-f13372f0fb83"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"NameError","evalue":"name 'gap_names' is not defined","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m                                 Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-2-2c3a52bad990>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<cell line: 0>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      1\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m# In Block 17, replace the text annotation loop with this:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      2\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 3\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0;32mif\u001b[0m \u001b[0mgap_names\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m      4\u001b[0m     \u001b[0mplot_df_gaps\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mpd\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mDataFrame\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m{\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m'Fairness Gap Type'\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m \u001b[0mgap_names\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m'Gap Value'\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m \u001b[0mgap_values\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m}\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      5\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m: name 'gap_names' is not defined"]}]}]}
