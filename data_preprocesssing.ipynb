rate control and anti-coagulation, hypertension, lipids and\\nasthma/possible COPD (no PFT's noted in record/no smoking\\nhistory) admitted now with SOB/unstable angina.  The patient's\\ncurrent symptomatology began last friday [**12-12**] when she\\ndeveloped URI symptoms including nasal congestion and cough.\\nSince then she has noted increased dyspnea, increased episodes\\nof her anginal pain including at rest and cough productive of\\nyellow/celery colored sputum.  Dyspnea has increased to point\\nwhere she has trouble with stairs now where recently she has\\nnot.  Has dry cough at baseline attributed to Mavik, but her\\ncurrent cough is different.  Has also had significantly\\nincreased fatigue over this time.  Takes combivent or albuterol\\nwith some relief of shortness of breath.  Her SOB brought her to\\nsee her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1262**].  CXR was obtained and revealed no acute\\nprocess. Other history from that visit is unobtainable.\\nLast night she had palpitations and her shortness of breath\\nsubsequently worsened which ultimately brought her to [**Hospital1 18**]\\ntoday.\\nReports taking all her medications.

The LMCA had mild luminal\\nirregularities. The LAD artery was occluded in the mid-vessel.\\nThe left\\ncircumflex artery was proximally occluded with two distal OMs\\nwith a\\n\"jump\" segment filling via left to left collaterals. The RCA was\\nproximally occluded with many bridging collaterals supplying the\\ndistal\\nRCA and posterior LV branches.\\n2. Saphenous vein grafts were known to be occluded from a prior\\ncatheterization dated [**6-17**] and were therefore not visualized.\\n3. Graft angiography showed a widely patent LIMA to LAD,\\nsupplying the\\ndistal [**1-18**] of the LAD and large collaterals to the RCA and\\nr-PDA.\\n4. Left subclavian angiography showed a widely patent left\\nsubclavian\\nstent.\\n5. Resting hemodynamics showed normal left-sided filling\\npressure.\\n6. Left ventriculography showed mild global hypokinesis with\\nmore\\npronounced hypokinesis of the inferior wall. There was trace\\nmitral\\nregurgitation. The calculated LVEF was 45%.\\n7.

Evaluate\\nfor gallstones, or liver disease.\\n\\nThere are no prior studies for comparison.\\n\\nThe patient is status post cholecystectomy. The common bile duct\\nmeasures 5\\nmm, and is within normal limits status post cholecystectomy. The\\nliver shows\\nno focal abnormalities. The liver parenchyma is mildly\\nhyperechoic in\\nechotexture, consistent with fatty infiltration. The right\\nkidney measures\\n8.3 cm. There is a mild hyperechoic focus within the interpolar\\nright kidney,\\nwith no evidence of posterior shadowing, possibly representing a\\nsmall\\nparenchymal calcification Within the lateral aspect of the right\\nkidney, in\\nthe interpolar region, there is a 1.2-cm anechoic focus, most\\nlikely\\nrepresenting a simple cyst. The left kidney measures 8.1 cm,\\nwith no focal\\nabnormalities.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n\\n1) Patient is status post cholecystectomy.\\n\\n2) The liver is echogenic, consistent with fatty liver. However,\\nother forms\\nof liver disease, and more advanced liver disease, including\\nsignificant\\nhepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.\\n\\n[**12-24**] chest x-ray:\\nINDICATION: Shortness of breath, s/p extubation. Check status.\\n\\nFINDINGS: A single AP semi-upright image. Comparison study dated\\n[**2149-12-21**]. The heart shows slight left ventricular enlargement. There\\nis evidence of\\na prior CABG procedure. A vascular stent is noted in the left\\nbrachiocephalic\\nvessel. The pulmonary vessels are normal. No pulmonary\\ninfiltrates are seen.\\nThere is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle and\\nslight widening\\nof the minor fissure consistent with a small effusion. The hila\\nand\\nmediastinum are otherwise unremarkable. The ETT and the NG line\\nremain well\\npositioned.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: Possible small right pleural effusion. No other\\nacute\\ncardiopulmonary abnormality. Prior CABG surgery noted and prior\\nleft\\nbrachiocephalic stent in place.\\n\\n\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\n72 year-old woman with CAD s/p CABG in [**2129**], stent to left\\nsubclavian in [**6-17**], re-cath in 02 as above, history of CHF,\\ndepressed EF,  hypertension, afib astham/COPD who presents now\\nwith increasing SOB and anginal episodes after URI last Friday.\\n\\nCardiovascular:\\na)ischemia: Concerning past history, very high risk and now with\\ngood story for unstable angina [**Female First Name (un) **] admit. Patient was ruled out\\nfor MI on admission.  After stabilization of her pulmonary\\nissues, given her history and an echo which could not fully\\nassess LVEF and could not rule out RWMA, she went for cardiac\\ncatherterization and found to have no new lesions, patent LIMA\\nto LAD.\\nPatient maintained on ACE, beta-blocker, statin, aspirin, imdur.\\nImdur and beta-blocker titrated up.  D/ced calcium channel\\nblocker with likely systolic dysfunction and definite diastolic\\nCHF. Sublingual nitro as needed.  Had been on Mavik for unclear\\nreason, tolerating ACE here--would titrate up for heart failure\\nas below.\\nContinues to have seom angina with stress.\\n\\nb)pump: Patient noted to have depressed EF in past-35%? but no\\nrecent echo on admission.   Echo here showed: 1. The left atrium\\nis mildly dilated.\\n2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal\\ntechnical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be\\nfully excluded. LV systolic function appears depressed. Overall\\nleft ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.\\n3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)\\nmitral regurgitation is seen.\\n4. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. On\\nadmission, the patient was felt to be euvolemic to slightly\\nvolume overloaded and gently diuresed but her SOB was primarily\\ndue to astham/copd exacerbation. AFter transfer to ICU(see\\nbelow) patient received lots of fluids and needed to be\\ndiuresed.  Diuresed adequately for discharge--felt to be dry for\\ndischarge by exam and labs. Given that she was acutely\\ndecompensated from pulmonary perspective and volume overloaded\\nwhen echo was done, it was not felt to be fully accurate of\\nbaseline status.  Maintained on beta-blocker, ACE for ischemia\\nand HF.  Should titrate ACE/beta to HF goals based on repeat\\necho (lisinopril 20/toprol 150).\\n\\nc)rhythm; afib: has always been rate controlled, never\\ncardioverted.

Had been on dilt but with ? heart failure, systolic-held\\nand went up on beta-blocker for control.\\nConcerning anti-coagulation, we are holding coumadin until\\npatient has outpatient colonoscopy-had guiac positive stools and\\ncrit drop (also with neck hematoma after central line\\nplacement.)  Scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy and then to\\nre-start coumadin then.\\n\\nShortness of breath/hypoxemia: CHF vs. post URI Reactive airways\\ndisease vs. COPD vs. PE vs. pneumonia--ON admission, SOB felt\\nsecondary to astham exacerbation-Patient acutely decompensated,\\nwheezy on exam, sent to unit on day 2 of admission for\\nintubation.  Treated with predniesone, flovent, azithromycin\\nthen levaquin as well as nebs/inhalers.  HAd 5 day ICU stay and\\nthen was transferred out.  By discharge, not wheezy satting well\\non room air.  Felt to be RAD post bronchitis.  Was not fluid\\noverloaded on admit--was diuresed after ICU stay with lots of\\nfluids. On discharge satting well on room air.\\n\\nAnemia at baseline/Crit drop/guiaic positive: Patient had crit\\ndrop while in ICU.  She had a hematoma after central line\\nplacement as well as guiac positive stools. Was on heparin\\nduring this time for her afib, stopped at this time. She\\nstabilized after transfusion in ICU, and needed no further\\ntransfusions.  Neck hematoma is resolving.  Guiac positive\\nstools-she is scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy.  Re-address\\nanti-coagulation for afib after this. Do not want her on iron\\nuntil after colonoscopy.\\n\\nElevated LFT's, tbili and PTT: After being off heparin (on it\\nfor afib), stopped for crit drop in [**Name (NI) 102488**] PTT remained\\nelevated.  WAs on subcu heparin, lft's obtained which showed\\nmild transaminase elevation and t bili elevation.  Subcu heparin\\nstopped, RUQ U/S obtained showed fatty liver/h/o\\ncholecystectomy.

Evaluate\\nfor gallstones, or liver disease.\\n\\nThere are no prior studies for comparison.\\n\\nThe patient is status post cholecystectomy. The common bile duct\\nmeasures 5\\nmm, and is within normal limits status post cholecystectomy. The\\nliver shows\\nno focal abnormalities. The liver parenchyma is mildly\\nhyperechoic in\\nechotexture, consistent with fatty infiltration. The right\\nkidney measures\\n8.3 cm. There is a mild hyperechoic focus within the interpolar\\nright kidney,\\nwith no evidence of posterior shadowing, possibly representing a\\nsmall\\nparenchymal calcification Within the lateral aspect of the right\\nkidney, in\\nthe interpolar region, there is a 1.2-cm anechoic focus, most\\nlikely\\nrepresenting a simple cyst. The left kidney measures 8.1 cm,\\nwith no focal\\nabnormalities.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n\\n1) Patient is status post cholecystectomy.\\n\\n2) The liver is echogenic, consistent with fatty liver. However,\\nother forms\\nof liver disease, and more advanced liver disease, including\\nsignificant\\nhepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.\\n\\n[**12-24**] chest x-ray:\\nINDICATION: Shortness of breath, s/p extubation. Check status.\\n\\nFINDINGS: A single AP semi-upright image. Comparison study dated\\n[**2149-12-21**]. The heart shows slight left ventricular enlargement. There\\nis evidence of\\na prior CABG procedure. A vascular stent is noted in the left\\nbrachiocephalic\\nvessel. The pulmonary vessels are normal. No pulmonary\\ninfiltrates are seen.\\nThere is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle and\\nslight widening\\nof the minor fissure consistent with a small effusion. The hila\\nand\\nmediastinum are otherwise unremarkable. The ETT and the NG line\\nremain well\\npositioned.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: Possible small right pleural effusion. No other\\nacute\\ncardiopulmonary abnormality.

Patient was ruled out\\nfor MI on admission.  After stabilization of her pulmonary\\nissues, given her history and an echo which could not fully\\nassess LVEF and could not rule out RWMA, she went for cardiac\\ncatherterization and found to have no new lesions, patent LIMA\\nto LAD.\\nPatient maintained on ACE, beta-blocker, statin, aspirin, imdur.\\nImdur and beta-blocker titrated up.  D/ced calcium channel\\nblocker with likely systolic dysfunction and definite diastolic\\nCHF. Sublingual nitro as needed.  Had been on Mavik for unclear\\nreason, tolerating ACE here--would titrate up for heart failure\\nas below.\\nContinues to have seom angina with stress.\\n\\nb)pump: Patient noted to have depressed EF in past-35%? but no\\nrecent echo on admission.   Echo here showed: 1. The left atrium\\nis mildly dilated.\\n2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal\\ntechnical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be\\nfully excluded. LV systolic function appears depressed. Overall\\nleft ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.\\n3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)\\nmitral regurgitation is seen.\\n4. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. On\\nadmission, the patient was felt to be euvolemic to slightly\\nvolume overloaded and gently diuresed but her SOB was primarily\\ndue to astham/copd exacerbation. AFter transfer to ICU(see\\nbelow) patient received lots of fluids and needed to be\\ndiuresed.  Diuresed adequately for discharge--felt to be dry for\\ndischarge by exam and labs. Given that she was acutely\\ndecompensated from pulmonary perspective and volume overloaded\\nwhen echo was done, it was not felt to be fully accurate of\\nbaseline status.  Maintained on beta-blocker, ACE for ischemia\\nand HF.  Should titrate ACE/beta to HF goals based on repeat\\necho (lisinopril 20/toprol 150).\\n\\nc)rhythm; afib: has always been rate controlled, never\\ncardioverted.
